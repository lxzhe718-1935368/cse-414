I experiened a really bad time with Azure. Sometimes it's work fine, but most of time, Azure keep asking me to log in and keep showing me there is an error when log in. Most of the time, it took about 80s to run a query. For this assignment, when Azure in "fast" mode, I still can't tell the run time is faster. I use db browser(based on sqlite I think) to check run time in local and it even faster run in Azure. So I do not recommend students useing Azure for this assignment, I think the complexity for HW3 is not able to show the power of DBMS optimization. Some tools like db browser will be eaiser to use. For future co-workers I think SQLServer will be a good tool to manage project(like github? with access to data) and optimization can come in hady.
